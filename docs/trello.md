# GitCatGo - Trello

Hugb√∫narfockers will use [Trello](https://trello.com/b/LOMI4hBL/gitcatgo).

The Trello board is split into four columns:

 * Backlog
 * In Progress
 * Code Review
 * Completed

Description of the columns below.

### Backlog

Here we store user stories.

### In Progress

We drag stories from the Backlog into this column.

We assign ourselves to the story while we work on it.

### Code Review

When we have made a pull request we drag our story from the In Progress columns to this column.

We unassign ourselves from the story so that someone else can assign themselves to the story in order to review the pull request.

### Completed

When the pull request has been accepted and merged successfully, we drag the story to this column from the Code Review column.

Then we unassign ourselves from the story.

After the story is part of the master branch (not to be confused with the develop branch), archive the story. This removes the story from the Completed column.
