# GitCatGo - Branching

GitCatGo is to be developed using the [Feature branch workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow).

 * When starting work on a new feature, branch out from the master branch and name the new branch something descriptive.
 * When finished with the new feature, make a pull request into the master branch.

Team members will review code of pull requests.

You cannot review your own code!
