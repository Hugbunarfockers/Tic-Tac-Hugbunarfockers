Naming conventions:

 * All .java files use PascalCase.

 * Private variables use camelCase.
 * Constant/Final variables use UPPERCASE, this overrides other rules.
 * Method parameters always use camelCase.

Allman style is used for all brackets.

Maximum file length is 400 lines.

Maximum line length is 100 characters.

Keep in mind KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid) and SRP (Single Responsibility Principle).
