## Welcome to Tic-Tac-Hugbunarfockers
In this repository we are going to code the game Tic Tac Toe in Java. We are a group seven computer science students at Reykjavik University.
### About the game:
Tic-tac-toe is a 3-by-3 grid based game. Two players play simultaneously, player 1 is represented by 'x' and player 2 is represented by 'o'. The goal of the game is to get the same symbol in three adjacent cells. The first player to accomplish this wins the game. If neither of the players emerges victorious, the game is a draw.

### Our main goals in making the project:

 * Making a deployable product using continuous delivery
 * Making sure that no broken code was pushed to the master branch using continuous integration
 * Having at least 80% code coverage when testing



### We used the following tools to help us:

 * [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/) for continous integration
 * [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) for continous deployment
 * [Selenium](http://docs.seleniumhq.org/) for functional testing
 * [Codecov](https://codecov.io/) for code coverage
